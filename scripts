### Finding S.pneumo sequences 

1. Download sequences and .csv file containing sequence info from Global Pneumococcal Sequencing (GPS) database containing metadata and assemblies of serotype 3 genomes that could be used to generate an inital alignment for PrimalScheme. Genome ranges are from ~1.7-2.7mb. These sequences will download as contigs, so this will have to be accounted for in Snippy. 


### Running Snippy 

The easiest way to run Snippy is to use Yale's computer cluster, Ruddle. There are a few prior steps to complete before being able to run Snippy, listed below. Using my example, I navigated to my desired working directory and set up a conda environment containing Snippy and PrimalScheme. 

1. Ask for space off the login node 

```
salloc
```

2. Load the Miniconda module (use 'ml' or 'module load')

```
ml miniconda
```
